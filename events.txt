You attended your lola's birthday celebration and had the most fun you've had in weeks. You had so much fun that you forgot the topics that you worked hard to understand over the past few days.
After three hours of studying, you read the messages in the group chat and regretted missing out on such a great party.
You spent hours studying, and once your family arrived, you feasted on the food they brought back.
You fell asleep while reading the messages and woke up only to find that you had embarrassingly sent a gibberish message to the group chat.

Peace was upon you, and you used your time to the fullest. You learned a lot and understood everything, but the guilt of not spending time with your family still lingers
Your sibling burst into your room and started crying, saying that you don't love them because you don't play with them anymore, leaving you feeling guilty.
You dominated the game and won, leaving you feeling accomplished. As a bonus, the game also helped you understand a concept you had previously struggled with.
Your parents came to your room and scolded you for not responding or acknowledging their call. You felt bad after they left, and in response, you drowned yourself in sad songs.
